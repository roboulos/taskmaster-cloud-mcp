# TaskMaster Cloud - ClearLeads Integration

## Context

During the ClearLeads project development on 2025-05-27, we identified the need for cloud-hosted task management to address several pain points:

1. **Real-time Visibility**: Jim needs to see progress as it happens
2. **Workspace Persistence**: Tasks survive Robert's workspace cloning workflow
3. **Collaboration**: Multiple team members can update task status
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of what was done when

## Integration Architecture

```
ClearLeads Development Workflow
            ↓
    Clone to Safe Workspace
            ↓
      Make Rapid Changes
            ↓
   Update TaskMaster Cloud ←── Jim Views Progress
            ↓
    Export Back to Production
```

## Benefits for ClearLeads

### 1. Transparency
- Jim can check progress without interrupting development
- Clear visibility into what's completed vs pending
- Time tracking for accurate billing

### 2. Continuity
- Tasks persist across workspace clones
- No loss of context between sessions
- Historical record of all changes

### 3. Acceleration
- MCP speed + cloud persistence
- No manual task tracking overhead
- Automated status updates

## Project-Specific Configuration

### Project Key
```
project_key: "client-clearleads"
```

### Task Categories
- CSV Processing Pipeline
- Lead Validation Engine
- API Endpoints
- Frontend Integration
- Testing & QA

### Sample Task Structure
```javascript
{
  "project_key": "client-clearleads",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": "1",
      "title": "Fix CSV upload parsing",
      "status": "done",
      "priority": "high"
    },
    {
      "task_id": "2",
      "title": "Implement lead validation",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "priority": "high",
      "subtasks": [
        {
          "task_id": "2.1",
          "title": "Email validation",
          "status": "done"
        },
        {
          "task_id": "2.2",
          "title": "Phone validation",
          "status": "pending"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Timeline

### Immediate (This Session)
- ✅ Create cloud infrastructure
- ✅ Document integration plan
- 🔄 Return to ClearLeads development

### Next Session
- [ ] Complete API implementations
- [ ] Migrate existing ClearLeads tasks
- [ ] Give Jim access to view progress

### Future
- [ ] Webhook on task completion
- [ ] Daily summary emails
- [ ] Billing integration for time tracking

## Usage During Development

### For Robert (Developer)
```bash
# In terminal while working
claude> Update task 2.1 to done - email validation complete
claude> Add task 3 - Implement batch processing endpoint
claude> Show pending tasks for ClearLeads
```

### For Jim (Client)
```bash
# Via web dashboard (future) or API
GET /api/taskmaster/client-clearleads/tasks?status=pending
GET /api/taskmaster/client-clearleads/progress
GET /api/taskmaster/client-clearleads/completed-today
```

## Migration from Local TaskMaster

1. Export existing tasks.json
2. Transform to cloud format
3. Bulk import via API
4. Verify data integrity
5. Switch MCP to cloud mode

## Success Metrics

- **Task Updates**: Real-time vs batch
- **Visibility**: Jim checks per day
- **Persistence**: Zero task loss across clones
- **Velocity**: Tasks completed per session
- **Accuracy**: Billing alignment with actual work

## Next Steps

1. Complete ClearLeads MVP with local TaskMaster
2. Migrate tasks to cloud in next session
3. Give Jim read access to his project
4. Iterate based on usage patterns
